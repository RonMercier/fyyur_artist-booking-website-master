## Fyyur

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

You will need to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

## Project Overview

* [Tech Stack (Dependencies)](#tech-stack-(dependencies)) 
* [Project Structure](#project-structure) 
* [Development Setup](#development-setup) 
* [Web Server and Database Setup](#web-server-and-database-setup) 


## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
The tech stack includes the following:
 * **virtualenv** is the tool used to create isolated Python environments
 * **PostgreSQL** is the relational database of choice
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** is the library used to communicate with the relational database
 * **Python3** and **Flask** is the server language and server framework used
 * **Flask-Migrate** is used for creating and running schema migrations
   
You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` as:
```
pip install virtualenv
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install postgres
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-Migrate
```

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.
```
node -v
npm -v
```
Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:
```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```


## Project Structure

  ```sh
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.py *** the main driver of the app. Includes your SQLAlchemy models.
                    "python app.py" to run after installing dependencies
  ├── config.py *** Database URLs, CSRF generation, etc
  ├── error.log
  ├── forms.py *** Your forms
  ├── requirements.txt *** The dependencies we need to install with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
  ├── static
  │   ├── css 
  │   ├── font
  │   ├── ico
  │   ├── img
  │   └── js
  └── templates
      ├── errors
      ├── forms
      ├── layouts
      └── pages
  ```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
* `templates/layouts` -- Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
* `templates/forms` -- Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
* `app.py` -- Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handles data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
* Models in `app.py` -- Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
* `config.py` -- Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.

#### Data Handling with `Flask-WTF` Forms
The web app uses an interactive form builder library called [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/). This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in `forms.py` file. The WTForms are instantiated in the `app.py` file. For example, in the `create_shows()` function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: `form = ShowForm()`. To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a `data` attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the `venue_id` data from the Venue form, you can use: `show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data)`, instead of using `request.form['venue_id']`.

## Development Setup
1. **Download the project starter code locally**
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/FSND.git
cd FSND/projects/01_fyyur/starter_code 
```

2. **Create an empty repository in your Github account online. To change the remote repository path in your local repository, use the commands below:**
```
git remote -v 
git remote remove origin 
git remote add origin <https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git>
git branch -M master
```
Once you have finished editing your code, you can push the local repository to your Github account using the following commands.
```
git add . --all   
git commit -m "your comment"
git push -u origin master
```

3. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**
```
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
>**Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

4. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

6. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
Navigate to project homepage [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) 


## Web Server and Database Setup

You can view a live version of the web application at www.fyyur.live

This project provisions a 2GB Ubuntu server that utilizes the popular web server Nginx and a 4GB PostgreSQL Managed Database.  The two resources below can assist you with setting this up:
